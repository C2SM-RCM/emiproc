Vertical Profiles 
=================

Vertical information can be added in many ways.

Vertical data in emiproc is always the height over the ground.

We can distinguish the cases as follow:
1. a point in the vertical domain
2. an area in the vertical domain

Operations to implement 
-----------------------

Add inventories (should scale each grid cell total values to do a weighted sum of the profiles)

Temporal Profiles
=================



Examples
========

Vertical profile based on roof heights.
---------------------------------------

Adding an elevation to each source.

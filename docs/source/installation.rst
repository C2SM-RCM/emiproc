Installation
============

With pip
--------

The easiest way to install emiproc is to use pip. This will install the latest
release from PyPI.

.. code:: bash

    pip install emiproc

From source
-----------


First create a folder for emiproc and go into it 

.. code:: bash

    mkdir emiproc 
    cd emiproc


Clone the repository

.. code:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/C2SM-RCM/emiproc.git .


Then install using pip.
Installing as an editable (`-e` options) allows you to directly modify 
the cloned code.

.. code:: bash

    pip install -e .
